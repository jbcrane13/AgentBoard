Investigate current AgentBoard gateway lifecycle, compare with OpenClaw reference implementation, and produce a concrete fix plan (patch or refactor) with risk notes.","notes":"Investigation (2026-02-24): Confirmed gateway rejects connect params with missing nonce. Probe response from ws://127.0.0.1:18789 =\u003e {code: INVALID_REQUEST, message: \"invalid connect params: at /device: must have required property 'nonce'\"}. Current AgentBoard GatewayClient.connect passes nonce:nil to buildAuthPayload and omits device.nonce. This regresses AGENTS.md Gateway Connection requirements. Compared with OpenClaw reference (apps/shared/OpenClawKit/GatewayChannel.swift): waits for connect.challenge nonce, builds v2 payload with nonce, includes device.nonce in connect params. No GatewayClient/OpenClawService tests currently cover handshake invariants.\nWorkspace reconciliation (2026-02-24): validated dirty files are internally consistent gateway/ATS changes. project.yml now defines generated Info.plist with NSAppTransportSecurity.NSAllowsLocalNetworking=true; xcodegen generate reproduces pbxproj delta. AgentBoard-Info.plist is generated and currently untracked. pbxproj also drops stale NewSessionOutcomeTests.swift references (file absent on disk). Build gate passed after reconcile: xcodebuild -project AgentBoard.xcodeproj -scheme AgentBoard -destination 'platform=macOS' build.\nImplemented fix in GatewayClient: now waits for connect.challenge nonce before connect RPC; uses nonce in buildAuthPayload(v2) and device.nonce; no longer sends nonce:nil. Also hardened request send race by registering pendingRequests continuation before async send. Added connect-challenge waiter lifecycle cleanup on disconnect/reconnect and timeout error path. Updated AGENTS.md + CLAUDE.md handshake docs to challenge-based nonce flow. Verification: xcodebuild build passed. Full xcodebuild test run blocked by UI/device infra (passcode-protected device warnings); focused AgentBoardTests run still shows pre-existing suite failures unrelated to this patch (AppConfigStore path normalization expectations + ChatSendThinkingTests baseline failures).\nDeep refactor pass (OpenClaw-inspired) completed in GatewayClient: added unified RPC timeout handling (default 15s via request timeout tasks), explicit connect-request timeout (~12s), connect-challenge timeout (~6s), and inbound-frame watchdog (~2x tick interval) that triggers reconnect on stale connection. Added robust failed-connect cleanup path to cancel socket/tasks and fail pending continuations without finishing event subscribers. Parsed hello.policy.tickIntervalMs to drive watchdog cadence.

{"id":"AB-zd9","title":"Session Notes view — daily workspace log + ontology entries","description":"Add a 'Notes' tab to AgentBoard that shows the daily workspace memory notes and ontology graph entries for any given day.\n\n## What it shows\nA date-navigable journal view with two sections:\n\n### Section 1 — Daily Notes\nRender ~/.openclaw/workspace/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md as formatted text.\n- Header: date formatted nicely ('Monday, February 24')\n- Prev/Next day arrow buttons + 'Today' button (disabled when already on today)\n- If no file for the selected date: muted 'No notes for this day' empty state\n- Render markdown: bold, code blocks (monospaced), headers, bullet lists\n  Use AttributedString or a simple markdown renderer (NSAttributedString + down, or manual .font modifiers for headers/bold/code). No external deps.\n\n### Section 2 — Knowledge Graph Entries\nParse ~/.openclaw/workspace/memory/ontology/graph.jsonl and show entries\nwhere properties.date == selected date.\n- Show Decisions, Lessons, and Bugs logged that day\n- Each entry: type badge (Decision/Lesson/Bug pill), title/summary (1-2 lines), project link if related\n- Grouped by type, collapsed if empty\n- Empty state per group: none shown if no entries for that type\n\n## New files\n- AgentBoard/Services/WorkspaceNotesService.swift\n  - @Observable @MainActor\n  - selectedDate: Date (default: today)\n  - dailyNotes: String (raw markdown content, empty if no file)\n  - ontologyEntries: [OntologyDayEntry] (type, id, title/summary, project?)\n  - func goToDate(_ date: Date)\n  - func goToPreviousDay() / goToNextDay() / goToToday()\n  - Reads files on demand (no polling needed — only reload on date change)\n\n- AgentBoard/Views/Notes/NotesView.swift\n  - Uses WorkspaceNotesService (via AppState or as @State)\n  - Two-section layout (daily notes top, ontology bottom)\n  - Date nav bar at top\n\n## AppState changes\n- Add: var notesService = WorkspaceNotesService()\n- Call notesService.goToDate(Date()) on init or first load\n\n## CenterTab + ContentView changes\n- Add case: notes = 'Notes' to CenterTab enum\n- Add NotesView() to tabContent switch\n- Add tab button (it already iterates CenterTab.allCases so it auto-appears)\n\n## Markdown rendering\nNo external deps. Use Swift's AttributedString with .init(markdown:) for simple rendering, wrapped in a Text view. For fallback, just use Text with monospaced font for code blocks detected via regex. Keep it simple.\n\n## Structs\nstruct OntologyDayEntry: Identifiable {\n    let id: String\n    let type: String       // 'Decision', 'Lesson', 'Bug'\n    let title: String      // properties.title ?? properties.summary ?? id\n    let summary: String    // properties.summary ?? ''\n    let projectId: String? // related project if linked\n    let status: String?\n}\n\n## Constraints\n- Swift 6 strict concurrency (SWIFT_STRICT_CONCURRENCY: complete)\n- @Observable + @MainActor, match AppState patterns\n- No new SPM packages\n- XcodeGen — never edit project.pbxproj; run xcodegen generate after any project.yml change\n- Match AppTheme styling throughout\n- Build must pass: xcodebuild build -scheme AgentBoard -destination 'platform=macOS'","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"blake.crane@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-25T00:45:45Z","created_by":"Blake Crane","updated_at":"2026-02-25T00:49:51Z","closed_at":"2026-02-25T00:49:51Z","close_reason":"NotesView + WorkspaceNotesService built and building clean"}

No backup/restore block — test mutates ~/.agentboard/config.json without cleanup\n2. Saves AppConfig(projects: []) — empty projects triggers loadOrCreate() auto-discovery which overwrites selectedProjectPath with first real project found ('/Users/blake/Projects/AgentBoard')\n\nEXACT FIX NEEDED:\na) Add 'let backup = try backupConfig(); defer { try? restoreConfig(from: backup) }' at top of test\nb) Change 'projects: []' to 'projects: [ConfiguredProject(path: \"/tmp/ab-test-project\", icon: \"🔧\")]' so auto-discovery logic is skipped (only runs when projects.isEmpty)\n\nFile: AgentBoardTests/AppConfigStoreTests.swift (~line 250, func loadOrCreateReadsExistingConfig)","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"blake.crane@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-26T19:26:15Z","created_by":"Blake Crane","updated_at":"2026-02-26T19:41:39Z"}
