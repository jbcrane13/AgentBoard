Probe response from ws:\/\/127.0.0.1:18789 => {code: INVALID_REQUEST, message: \"invalid connect params: at \/device: must have required property 'nonce'\"}. Current AgentBoard GatewayClient.connect passes nonce:nil to buildAuthPayload and omits device.nonce. This regresses AGENTS.md Gateway Connection requirements. Compared with OpenClaw reference (apps\/shared\/OpenClawKit\/GatewayChannel.swift): waits for connect.challenge nonce, builds v2 payload with nonce, includes device.nonce in connect params. No GatewayClient\/OpenClawService tests currently cover handshake invariants.\nWorkspace reconciliation (2026-02-24): validated dirty files are internally consistent gateway\/ATS changes. project.yml now defines generated Info.plist with NSAppTransportSecurity.NSAllowsLocalNetworking=true; xcodegen generate reproduces pbxproj delta. AgentBoard-Info.plist is generated and currently untracked. pbxproj also drops stale NewSessionOutcomeTests.swift references (file absent on disk). Build gate passed after reconcile: xcodebuild -project AgentBoard.xcodeproj -scheme AgentBoard -destination 'platform=macOS' build.\nImplemented fix in GatewayClient: now waits for connect.challenge nonce before connect RPC; uses nonce in buildAuthPayload(v2) and device.nonce; no longer sends nonce:nil. Also hardened request send race by registering pendingRequests continuation before async send. Added connect-challenge waiter lifecycle cleanup on disconnect\/reconnect and timeout error path. Updated AGENTS.md + CLAUDE.md handshake docs to challenge-based nonce flow. Verification: xcodebuild build passed. Full xcodebuild test run blocked by UI\/device infra (passcode-protected device warnings); focused AgentBoardTests run still shows pre-existing suite failures unrelated to this patch (AppConfigStore path normalization expectations + ChatSendThinkingTests baseline failures).\nDeep refactor pass (OpenClaw-inspired) completed in GatewayClient: added unified RPC timeout handling (default 15s via request timeout tasks), explicit connect-request timeout (~12s), connect-challenge timeout (~6s), and inbound-frame watchdog (~2x tick interval) that triggers reconnect on stale connection. Added robust failed-connect cleanup path to cancel socket\/tasks and fail pending continuations without finishing event subscribers. Parsed hello.policy.tickIntervalMs to drive watchdog cadence.
